# StoQuotes
Hi, welcome to StoQuotes. StoQuotes is a Javascript frontend and Ruby on Rails backbend app where users have the ability to get quotes from a rich variety of methods, and write a story for any given quote. StoQuotes is my fourth milestone project at the Flatiron School software engineering program. StoQuotes is inspired on my very first app, a command line interface (CLI) ruby app, with many more added functionalities. For reference, the backend repo for StoQuotes can be found [here](https://github.com/mmartinezluis/stoquotes-backend). You can find also a Medium article for StoQuotes [here](https://luis-mmartinez.medium.com/javascript-event-listeners-f733052ab0c0). 

## Functionality
StoQuotes consists of two main components: a Quote rendering and Story writing component, and a Story reading and editing component. I call the first component the "Black Box", as the box supports more than ten different functionalities. In Stoquotes users have the ability to:
* Get a description of the functionalities of the app on the app's landing tab, the Home tab.
* Get a random quote upon clicking the Quote tab, and continue to get a new random quote for each click on the Quote tab.
* Get a list of ten random authors upon clicking the Authors tab, and continue to get a new set of ten random authors upon each click on the Authors tab (the new set replaces the previous set upon each click).
* Get a list of ten categories upon clicking the Categories tab.
* Get an author-search form upon clicking the Search Author tab.
* Write a story within the Quute tab upon clicking on the "Wrtie a Story" button after the quote is rendered.
* Get a quote from any given author in the Authors tab upon clicking on an author's name, and continue to get a new quote from the author for each click on the author's name.
* Write a story for any quote rendered in the Authors tab.
* Get a quote upon clicking on any category name in the Categories tab, and continue to get a new quote from the clicked category for each click.
* Write a story for any quote rendered in the Categories tab. 
* Write the name of an author in the form rendered by the Author Search tab. The name of the author will show up as an option if the author is in the database. Upon clicking on the "Get Quote" button, a quote from the selected author will be rendered; in addition, a new quote from the selected author will be renderd for each click on the "Get Quote" button. 
* Write a story for any quote rendered in the Search Author tab. 
* Some more functionalities...
